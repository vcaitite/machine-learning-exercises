Contains exercise solutions for the following topics: 

1. TP1 - Classification methods based on different principles will be used and compared in a binary classification problem of exoplanet candidates. 
Methods: 
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree 
  - SVM (svm with linear, sigmoid, polynomial and RBF kernels)
  - k-NN
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Tree Boosting

2. TP2 - Implementation, study and application of AdaBoost algorithm. The Adaptive Boosting was applied to the Tic-Tac-Toe dataset from UCI .
